# Ray Tracing Template

This is a rough template to be used as a base for 2 additional renderers, one monte-carlo, and the other a rasterised hybrid renderer as part of my 4th year university research project. It is the intent for this project to contain a rough real-time monte-carlo ray tracer implementation, along with the facilities to benchmark and modify the scene (or at least a baseline to be imrpoved later).

The base application runs in Vulkan and is implemented using [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut).
